<h2>Documentation – Add Selenium</h2>

<p>
PowerShell 4.0 uses .Net 4.5 so the first thing to do is download the Selenium C# language package 
(if you find “.nupkg” files inside the zip then append “.zip” to the end of each “.nupkg” file, 
you want to open the Selenium.WebDriver.3.6.0.nupkg file to extract the WebDriver.dll file) from Selenium’s download page and extract the net45/ directory. 
We’ll use the WebDriver.dll file in our PowerShell scripts.
We require the IE, Firefox or Chrome driver from the Selenium downloads page.
